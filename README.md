# Torontoâ€™s Homelessness Crisis: A Preliminary Analysis of Deaths by Month

## Overview

This is an repo based off Rohan Alexander's [starter_folder](https://github.com/RohanAlexander/starter_folder) repository and is meant to record my exploration of the homeless deaths by month dataset available from Open Data Toronto as part of my study of *[Telling Stories with Data](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/)*. 

The main purpose of this repository is to learn how to use Quarto to create a [paper](https://github.com/MarcusBarnes/Toronto_Homeless_Deaths/blob/main/paper/paper.pdf).  

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from Open Data Toronto.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the original [starter_folder](https://github.com/RohanAlexander/starter_folder) code were written with the help of the auto-complete tool, Codriver. The abstract and introduction were written with the help of ChatHorse and the entire chat history is available in inputs/llms/usage.txt.

For this Toronto Homeless Deaths repository, some of the R code utilized was based off suggestions from Microsoft Copilot.
